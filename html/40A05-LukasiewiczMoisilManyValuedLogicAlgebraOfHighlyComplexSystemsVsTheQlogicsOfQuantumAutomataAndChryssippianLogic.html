<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Long before Boole, Chrysippus of Soli (Ancient Greek: Chrysippos ho Soleus; c. 279–206 BC) – who was a Greek Stoic philosopher– introduced the idea
of a two-value logic, now called Boolean. It is the operational logic of everyday computing and Hilbert’s theory of Logical Predicates or Symbolic Logic.
The first system of multiple-valued logic was introduced by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1920, and independently, by E. Post who also introduced in 1921 a different multiple-valued logic that carries his name. Subsequently, in 1930’s Łukasiewicz and Tarski studied a logic with truth values in the continuous interval <math id="S1.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[0,1]" display="inline"><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow></math> of real numbers. However, an <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">algebraic</em> formulation of many-valued (MV) logic was missing until its introduction by Acad. Grigore C. Moisil who defined the 3-valued and 4-valued Łukasiewicz algebras in 1940 [31], and the <math id="S1.p1.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-valued
Łukasiewicz algebras (<math id="S1.p1.m3" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n&gt;2" display="inline"><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow></math>) in 1942. Boolean algebras, that are defined as algebraic models of classical, or chryssipian-Boolean logic, are then only particular cases of the new structures. of MV-logic. In the description of a logical system, the implication was traditionally the principal connector. The n-valent system of Łukasiewicz had as truth values the elements of a certain set <math id="S1.p1.m4" class="ltx_Math" alttext="L_{n}" display="inline"><msub><mi>L</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></math> and was built around a new concept of implication, on which are based the definitions of the other connectors. On the other hand for Moisil and modern mathematical logicians, the basic structure is that of a <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">lattice</em>, to which he added a negation (thus generating the so-called ”De Morgan algebra”) together with certain unary operations (that were called by Moisil <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">“chryssipian endomorphisms”</em>), that represent the “nuancing”, or <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">nuances</em> of MV-logic. Therefore, the fundamental concept of Moisil logic is that of nuancing.The Łukasiewicz implication has then taken secondary place, and– in the case of an arbitrary valence– was completely left out. lt is henceforth appropriate to refer to such <math id="S1.p1.m5" class="ltx_Math" alttext="MV" display="inline"><mrow><mi>M</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow></math>-algebras as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Łukasiewicz-Moisil algebras</em> or <math id="S1.p1.m6" class="ltx_Math" alttext="LM" display="inline"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></math><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">- logic algebras</span>. The logic corresponding to <math id="S1.p1.m7" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>-valued Łukasiewicz-Moisil algebras was published by Moisil in 1964 [35].</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A characterization of the category of <math id="S1.p2.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="LM" display="inline"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></math><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">- logic algebras</span> was published by Georgescu and Vraciu in 1970 [15]. A more detailed account of <math id="S1.p2.m2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="LM" display="inline"><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>⁢</mo><mi>M</mi></mrow></math>–logic algebras than the early work reported in [15] was recently published in refs.[1] and [16], with the latter paper also including a comparison among several MV-logics such as the Post logic, as well as the relevance of MV-logics to Complex Systems Biology (CSB), highly-complex systems, fuzzy structures, the MV-logic foundations of Probability Theory and Biostatistics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Interestingly, Acad. Moisil also considered the applications of LM-logic algebras to switching circuits, new designs of automata and computers based on LM-logic algebras [32]-[33], [37]-[39]; his early results in the latter fields are also pertinent to this article. An alternative approach is provided by the formalism of variable categories [40] that would allow in principle the construction of artificial intelligence systems with varying transition functions which would exhibit adaptive, learning behaviors.
We are taking further these previous results and ideas through a comparison of LM-logic algebra categories– and their appications to representations of functional genomes and genetic networks–with the operational Q–logic algebras of categories of both quantum automata and quantum supercomputers that may result in a deeper understanding of highly-complex systems and also in improved design, biomimetic strategies for artificial intelligent meta–systems.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2. </span>Algebraic Logic, Operational and Łukasiewicz Quantum Logic</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As pointed out by Birkhoff and von Neumann as early as 1936, a logical foundation of quantum mechanics consistent with quantum algebra is essential for both the completeness and mathematical validity of the theory. The development of Quantum Mechanics from its very beginnings both inspired and required the consideration of specialized logics that are designed to be compatible with a new theory of measurements applicable to microphysical systems. Such a specialized logic was initially formulated by Birkhoff and von Neumann in 1936, and called ‘Quantum Logic’ or Q-logic (QL). However, in recent QL research several distinct approaches were developed involving several types of non-distributive lattice, and their corresponding algebras, for <math id="S2.p1.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n" display="inline"><mi>n</mi></math>–valued quantum logics. Thus, modifications of the Łukasiewicz, and indeed of Łukasiewicz-Moisil (LM) logic algebras, that were introduced in the context of algebraic categories [14] by Georgescu and Popescu [15] (also recently reviewed and expanded by Georgescu [16]) can provide an appropriate framework for representing quantum systems; alternatively, in their unmodified form, such LM-logic algebras were found to be instrumental in describing, or formally representing, the activities of complex networks in categories of such LM-logic algebras [6].</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">There is, nevertheless, a serious problem remaining in the recent Q-logic literature which is caused by the logical inconsistency between any quantum algebra and the Heyting logic algebra that has been seriously suggested as a candidate for quantum logic. Furthermore, quantum algebra and topological approaches that are ultimately based on <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">set-theoretical</em> concepts and differentiable spaces (manifolds) also encounter serious problems of internal inconsistency. Since it has been shown that standard set theory– which is subject to the axiom of choice– relies on Boolean logic, there appears to exist a basic logical inconsistency between the quantum logic–which is not Boolean–and the Boolean logic underlying all differentiable manifold approaches that rely on continuous spaces of points, or certain specialized sets of elements. A possible solution to such inconsistencies is the definition of a generalized Topos concept, and more specifically, of an Extended Quantum Topos (EQT) concept which is consistent with both Q-logic and Quantum logic algebras, thus being potentially suitable for the development of a framework that may unify quantum field theories with ultra-complex system modeling and Complex Systems Biology (CSB).</p>

Several encouraging results in this direction were recently obtained by Dala Chiara and coworkers.

<p class="ltx_p">The concepts of quantum automata and quantum computation were initially studied, and are also currently further investigated, in the contexts of quantum genetics, genetic networks with nonlinear dynamics, and bioinformatics. In a previous publication [2]– after introducing the formal concept of quantum automaton–the possible implications of this concept for correctly modeling genetic and metabolic activities in functional (living) cells and organisms were also considered. This was followed by a formal report on quantum and abstract, symbolic computation based on the theory of categories, functors and natural transformations [3]. The notions of topological semigroup, quantum automaton, or quantum computer, were then suggested with a view to their potential applications to the analogous simulation of biological systems, and especially genetic activities and nonlinear dynamics in genetic networks [6]–[7].</p>

Molecular models in terms of categories, functors and natural transformations were then formulated for uni-molecular chemical transformations, multi-molecular chemical and biochemical transformations [7]. Previous applications of computer modeling, classical automata theory, and relational biology to molecular biology, oncogenesis and medicine were extensively reviewed in a monograph [7], and several important conclusions were reached regarding both the potential and the limitations of computation-assisted modeling of biological systems, especially those concerned with very complex organisms such as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Homo sapiens sapiens</em> [7]– [10].

<p class="ltx_p">Non-distributive varieties of many-valued, LM-logic algebras that are also noncommutative open new possibilities for formal treatments of both complex quantum systems and highly complex biological networks, such as genetic nets, metabolic-replication systems (see for example refs. [19]–[20] and [22]), the interactome [6] and neural networks [7]. This novel approach that involves both Algebraic Logic and Category Theory, provides an important framework for understanding the complexity inherent in intelligent systems and their flexible, adaptive behaviors. A consequence of the Logical Adjointness Theorem– which defines categorically the natural equivalence between the category of centered LM-logic algebras and that of Boolean logic algebras– is that one may be able to define Artificial Intelligence analogs of neural networks based on centered LM-logic algebras. In this process, higher dimensional algebra (HDA; [12]-[13]) and categorical models of human brain dynamics (refs. [8]–[11]) were predicted to play a central role. These new approaches are also relevant for resolving the tug-of-war between nature-vs.-nurture theories of human development and the ‘natural’ emergence through co-evolution of intelligence in the first <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">H. sapiens sapiens</em> societies.</p>

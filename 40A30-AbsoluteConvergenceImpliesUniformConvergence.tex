\begin{thm}
Let $T$ be a topological space, $f$ be a continuous function from $T$ to $[0,\infty)$, and 
let $\{f_k\}_{k=0}^\infty$ be a sequence of continuous functions from $T$ to $[0,\infty)$
such that, for all $x \in T$, the sum $\sum_{k=0}^\infty f_k (x)$ converges to $f(x)$.  Then 
the convergence of this sum is uniform on compact subsets of $T$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $X$ be a compact subset of $T$ and let $\epsilon$ be a positive real number.  We will
construct an open cover of $X$.  Because the series is assumed to converge pointwise, for 
every $x \in X$, there exists  an integer $n_x$ such that $\sum_{k=n_x}^\infty f_k (x) < \epsilon 
/ 3$.  By continuity, there exists an open neighborhood $N_1$ of $x$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| 
< \epsilon /3$ when $y \in N_1$ and an open neighborhood $N_2$ of $x$ such that $\left| 
\sum_{k=0}^{n_x} f_k (x) - \sum_{k=0}^{n_x}  f_k (y) \right| < \epsilon / 3$ when $y \in N_2$.  
Let $N_x$ be the intersection of $N_1$ and $N_2$.  Then, for every $y \in N_x$, we have
\[
 f(y) - \sum_{k=0}^{n_x} f_k (y) < |f(y) - f(x)| + 
                                   \left| f(x) - \sum_{k=0}^{n_x} f_k (x) \right| +
                                   \left| \sum_{k=0}^{n_x} f_k (x) - \sum_{k=0}^{n_x} f_k (y) \right|
                                 < \epsilon .
\]
In this way, we associate to every point $x$ an neighborhood $N_x$ and an integer $n_x$.
Since $X$ is compact, there will exist a finite number of points $x_1, \ldots x_m$ such 
that $X \subseteq N_{x_1} \cup \cdots \cup N_{x_m}$.  Let $n$ be the greatest of $n_{x_1}, 
\ldots, n_{x_m}$.  Then we have $f(y) - \sum_{k=0}^n f_k (y) < \epsilon$ for all $y \in X$,
so, the functions $f_k$ being positive, $f(y) - \sum_{k=0}^h f_k (y) < \epsilon$ for all
$h \ge n$, which means that the sum converges uniformly.
\end{proof}

Note: This result can also be deduced from Dini's theorem, 
since the partial sums of positive functions are monotonically increasing.
